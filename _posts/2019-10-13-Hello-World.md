Packets and beer lives! Now that the bits are in place, packets are being sent, and things are off to a start its now time for .....well.... the beer!


This blog is meant to be a place where I can store things I have leared as well as easily share them with other people.


Usually posts will be classified as one of the follolwing items:

* packets
* tools
* networks
* labs

With more added as needed.


While this will be considered a professional blog it will also contain a couple of posts from time to time about beer. Things wouldnt be living up to the domain name if there wasnt. Also gives me an excuse to buy a nice camera and take a few pictures.

Big thanks to Barry Clark and his repo Jekyll Now (http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for providing the code to let me strap a jet pack to this blog and get to writting.
